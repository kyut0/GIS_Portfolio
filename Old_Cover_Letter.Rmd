\noindent To whom it may concern,  
<br />  
\indent I am writing to express my strong interest in the `r position` position. This document contains my resume, references, and an overview of my geospatial analysis experience. More information can be found at the relevant links, and I am reachable on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-yut/) or via email.      
<br />  
\indent As a `r adj1`, `r adj2`, and `r adj3`, I embody many of the traits `r company` is looking for in an ideal candidate. Additionally, I have ample experience navigating quantitative analyses and am familiar with a variety of platforms, languages, and software, such as R, ESRI ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, QGIS, ENVI, SQL, and Python. I am passionate about `r p1`, `r p2`, and `r p3`.  
<br />  
\indent I earned three degrees in less than five years, as evidence of my curiosity and ability to learn quickly. During my college career, I was also able to complete two formative internships: the first, a 10-week stint with NASA through the DEVELOP program, and the second, six months at E. & J. Gallo Winery. Most recently, I have been working for the Bureau of Economic Geology as a GIS Energy Analyst, completing projects in R and ArcMap to aid in energy and geology research. Ideally, I am looking for another opportunity with a challenging, collaborative environment that will further develop my geospatial analysis skills.  
<br />  
\indent Many of these skills were honed throughout my Geographic Information Science capstone. For this research project, I assisted with the initial stages of a [much larger research effort](https://ou.edu/research-norman/news-events/2020/ou-researchers-awarded-nasa-grant-to-study-disease-threats) studying the spread of zoonotic diseases in Central Asia, specifically along China's Belt and Road Initiative. My project developed a methodology for classifying the land use and land change in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, using spatiotemporal data in Google Earth Engine and RStudio. This methodology will be used to study the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and potential disease spread.   
<br />  
\indent Thank you for your time and consideration. It is my sincere hope that you get a sense for my commitment to geospatial analysis and creative, effective visualization. While the following document contains a representative sample of the relevant work I have done in the past, it is by no means a comprehensive account of who I am. I look forward to further discussing the position in the near future!  
<br />    
\noindent Cheers,
